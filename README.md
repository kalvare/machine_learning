This repository is an ongoing work for educational purposes related to machine learning. I find that the best way to learn is to implement ideas from scratch, to conduct first-hand experiments and to explain to others through writing. I have made this a public repository with an MIT license, in the hopes that others may also be able to benefit from this exercise.

This repository is primarily an exercise in exploration of knowledge. As such I will attempt to provide several viewpoints on the same ideas and connect as much as possible back to mathematical proofs. After all, don't trust me, trust the math.
